# GTD

A place for all the things I've wanted to make to do with task management but
haven't because life's to short.

## Mentions
Large amounts of the code, especially the Trello styles and general structure
came from [rcdexta/react-trello](https://github.com/rcdexta/react-trello).

In addition the dragging logic was sourced mainly from 
[kutlugsahin/smooth-dnd-demo](https://kutlugsahin.github.io/smooth-dnd-demo/)
as it avoided using the own dragging logic written in react-trello.

## Ideas
- [ In progress ] Ability to programmatically make different views for tasks.
    - E.g. Trello board and grid (Subject on horizontal, type (paper, marking,
    questions, etc) on vertical).
- Time tracking
    - Linking to Toggl but act more on the basis of marking time than tasks,
    e.g. awake, at school, in Library.
    - Still have concept of tasks tho I think?
    - So like marking and then also say, start task, stop task.
